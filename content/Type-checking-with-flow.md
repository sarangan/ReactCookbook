If you come to JavaScript from other programming languages you are familiar with types. You have types in JavaScript too, but you do not have to specify these types when declaring variables, receiving arguments etc. This is one of the things that makes JavaScript great, but at the same time not so great. 

Specifically when working on very large projects with many developers type checking gives stability to your project, much like a good test does. So using **Flow** is definitely not a requirement. It is for developers who depends on type checking as more of a routine and for the before mentioned large projects with many developers. Webpack makes it easy to include **Flow** in your workflow.

## Installing flow

- Have to try this out :-)
- What about "flowcheck-loader", tried it? https://www.npmjs.com/package/flowcheck-loader (probably works, haven't tried this one yet)
